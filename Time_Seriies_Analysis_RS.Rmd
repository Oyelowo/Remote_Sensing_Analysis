###Practical 4#######
###Script 4-1
###Create NDVI time-series for selected areas
###The parts of the script you need to fill or complement are marked with **




##**Load required packages (raster, maptools)
library(raster)
library(maptools)
 
##**Clear Environment e.g. rm(list = ls())
rm(list=ls())


#**set the work space for the folder where you saved the shapefiles files

#**read the shapefile of Forest and Savannah

```
For the forest, the vegetation reached peak 
In 2009-  Dec
2010, May
2011,  apr
2012- ,dec
2013- apr, 

However, overall, the vegetation reached peak in April, 2011


```{r}
##** inspect data to certify if you need to apply any scale factor
ndvi.forest <- ndvi.forest/10000
ndvi.forest
```




For the savanna, the peaks for each year:
In 2009- dec
2010- apr
2011- dec
2012- dec
2013- dec
However, generally, the savanna vegetation reached a peak in April 2010.


```{r}
ndvi.savannah <- ndvi.savannah/10000
ndvi.savannah
```


From below, we can see that the forest vegetation phenology is mainly bimodal with two peaks every year. This can be seen in the time series graph and the seasonal trend graph

The annual average NDVI for the forest region is 0.7498
```{r}
summary(ndvi.forest)
```


From the seasonal trend graph in the latter part, it can be seen that the vegetation phenology of the savanna is bimodal i.e with two peaks in every year.

```
The annual average NDVI for the savannah is 0.4271
```{r}
summary(ndvi.savannah)
```

##** add one line to create a time-series for the savannah data

save(ndvi.forest.ts, ndvi.savannah.ts, file = "TAITA_NDVI.RData") #This command saves the results in .RData format
#The RData format can store any variables from your workspace
#The advantage is that you can easily load again your results, without having to make all the calculations again
#it also keeps the format of the objects (for example, time-series objects remain like that when loaded by another script)

Yt refers to the data at that period of time. 
St refers to the seasonal component at that period of time. 
Tt refers to the trend-cycle component at that period of time. 
Et refers to the remainder (or irregular or error) component at period of time.



There were two trend breaks identified. One occured in towards the end of 2011 while the second occured in the last quarter of 2011.

#plot.new()
#legend("top", legend = c("Positive change", "Negative change", "No Change"), bty = c(1,1), fill = c("green" ,"yellow", "white"), cex= 1)


##Classification example##

#Let's say that "im.ratio" is the result of my image rationing analysis and "class.ratio" is the classified image (that still doesn't exist)
#class.ratio=im.ratio #first create "class.ratio" as an exact copy of im.ratio
#class.ratio[im.ratio>0.9 & im.ratio<1.1] <- 1 #where the values in im.ration are between 0.9 and 1.1, the values of class.ratio is set to 1
```



For the image rationing, the threshold was set for 0.9 and 1.1 and for the image differencing, the range is -0.05 and +0.05. This means that, within this range, the vegetation is believed to have not changed considerably, comparing 2009 and 2013. In other words, the ndvi value has remained relatively unchanged. However, above this(1.1 or +0.05) means there has been a positive change and the vegetation might have become denser, healthier and greener. Below this threshold(i.e<0.9 or -0.05 means that there has been a negative change and the vegetation might have been depleted/degraded or suffered physiological stress and therefore, become less healthy.
In a nutshell, the change is being caused by the change in the vegetation health and it can be that the density of the vegetation has increased.

###Practical 4#######
###Script 4-4
###Perform change vector analysis and plot polar histogram

##** load the raster and maptools packages
#library(raster)
#library(maptools)

##**set the work space for the folder where you saved the MODIS red and NIR band files
setwd("C:/Users/oyelo/Desktop/advanced remote sensing/practical 4/Material_and_Scripts_P4/Tasks_4_MODIS_red_NIR")
getwd()

##**read red band from September 2013
red.date1<-raster("MOD13Q1.2013241.red.UTM_Taita.tif")

##**read red band from December 2013

##**read NIR band from September 2013

##**read NIR band from December 2013
nir.date2<-raster("MOD13Q1.2013353.NIR.UTM_Taita.tif")

##The following lines calculate the change angles
##To understand the change angle calculation, refer to the equations in the lecture material
delta.NIR=nir.date2-nir.date1 #Calculated NIR difference between September and December
delta.red=red.date2-red.date1 #Calculated red difference between September and December
alfa=atan((delta.red)/(delta.NIR)) #Calculate the change angle

alfa=(alfa*180)/pi #Convert change angle from radian to degrees

###The following code convert the angle values to a 0 to 360 degrees range### see lecture material
alfa[delta.NIR<0 & delta.red>0]<-(alfa+180)[delta.NIR<0 & delta.red>0]
alfa[delta.NIR<0 & delta.red<0]<-(alfa+180)[delta.NIR<0 & delta.red<0]
alfa[delta.NIR>0 & delta.red<0]<-(alfa+360)[delta.NIR>0 & delta.red<0]
alfa[delta.NIR==0 & delta.red!=0]<-270

#plot(alfa, main="change in angle image")#visualize the change angle image

intervals=seq(0, 360, by=5)#create a vector describing the intervals of the histogram
#First I create a normal histogram, with the intervals between 0 to 360 and the bars width equal to 5
#(we just need this to obtain the count of each angle value.. so you don't need to present this normal histogram in your report)
```


```{r, results='hide', echo=FALSE }
h=hist(alfa, breaks=intervals) #creates the normal histogram 
```


```{r}

frequency<-h$counts #counts the frequency of each angle
angle<-h$mids #gets the angle values

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
polar.plot(frequency,angle, main="CVA - Change angle",lwd=3,line.col=4) #Plot a polar histogram

#plot(frequency)
##**Calculate the change magnitude

change.mag<-sqrt((delta.red^2)+(delta.NIR^2))
hist(change.mag, main="Change in magnitude histogram")


par(mfrow=c(2,2))
#plot change angle image(from 0 to 360)
plot(alfa, main="change in angle image")#visualize the change angle image

##**Plot the histogram of the change magnitude
plot(change.mag, main="change in magnitude")


##**Calculate the NDVI for the September image
ndvi.sept<-(nir.date1-red.date1)/(nir.date1+red.date1)
plot(ndvi.sept, main="NDVI September")
##**Calculate the NDVI for the December image
ndvi.dec<-(nir.date2-red.date2)/(nir.date2+red.date2)
plot(ndvi.dec, main="NDVI December")

```

The average change angle is 313.1595 degree while the average change magnitude is 0.1001708. This can be seen below:
```{r}
mean(alfa[alfa])
mean(change.mag[change.mag])
```
Mainly just one kind of change can be identified from the CVA plot. It only shows differing magnitue but the angles of the bars are titled towards increasing greeness(+NIR) and decreasing brightness(-RED). This can also be seen from the averge angle of 313 degree. This can be due to the seasonal change from dry to wet when the vegetation is healthy, denser and greener.


The dominant land change that can be seen is the vegetation getting denser and greener.
